# Todo List
### [Live Demo](https://kumarsai131.github.io/Todo-List/)
#### Description
The project was devoloped by using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT. The project is responsive and uses local storage so that our data will never be lost. We can mark the completed tasks by clicking on the check icon. After refreshing the page the checked mark on the todo list will not disappear so it will be helpful for us to know which tasks are finished and which tasks are still pending. We can delete the task which we have completed by clicking on the trash icon.
